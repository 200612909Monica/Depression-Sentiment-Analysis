# Depression Detection via Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on simulated social media posts to detect potential signs of depression using Python and Power BI.

ðŸ§  Project Objective

To analyze sentiment polarity in user posts and classify them into:

Depressive

Neutral

Positive

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

Python (TextBlob for sentiment analysis)

Pandas for data processing

Power BI for visualization

Google Colab / Local environment for execution

ðŸ§ª Methodology

1. Data Simulation

A set of realistic social media-style posts were manually curated to simulate public mental health expressions.

2. Sentiment Analysis

Used TextBlob to calculate the polarity score of each post.

Applied thresholds to classify:

Polarity < -0.3 â†’ Depressive

-0.3 â‰¤ Polarity â‰¤ 0.3 â†’ Neutral

Polarity > 0.3 â†’ Positive

3. Data Export

Processed data was saved to depression_sentiment_final.csv for use in Power BI.

4. Visualization

Created visuals:

Pie Chart: Distribution of categories

Bar Chart: Average polarity by sentiment

Table: Full post + polarity + category
